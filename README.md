# SwiftUI-MVP

This is Playground project to apply SwiftUI in a real case scenario.

This playground implements Model View Presenter architecture with a view implemented in SwiftUI. 

The goal is to get simple views which in contrast to Apple examples are only responsabile of the view logic, extracting the business and the navigation logic out of the view layer.
